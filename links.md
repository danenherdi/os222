2.  [Security Problems in Operating Systems](https://padakuu.com/what-is-the-security-problem-149-article)<br>
After we know the basics of security management, of course there will be some problems that will be faced when handling a system. Therefore we need to know some kinds of these problems.

3.  [Linux File Permission](https://youtu.be/k1yzI7c6Fzk)<br>
Linux is an operating system that implements multiple users. This will cause multiple users to access the same system. Therefore, to maintain the security of the files in it, it is necessary to manage access to their respective files. <br>
[additional documents](https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/) (The document used in the video)<br>

To send something with more security, then one of the techniques is cryptography. This video will explain the basics of cryptography.

5. [Encryption and public keys](https://youtu.be/6-JjHa-qLPk)<br>
The world is already using a lock to ensure more secure communications. The key can be public so that everyone can then access it. Inside the key, of course, there is an encryption and decryption process. Therefore this video will show the concept of these aspects.

## W03
1. [Linux FIle System](https://youtu.be/HbgzrKJvDRw)<br>

This link provides an advanced explanation of virtual memory in addition to the explanation in the video.

3. [Process Table](https://exposnitc.github.io/os_design-files/process_table.html)(Article)<br>
This link will provide a system process that contains entries to a table where each entry contains some important information about a process. Of course, this is also related to the page table process which contains information about the physical location of a process from the pages.

## W06
1. [Process](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/operating-system-processes#:~:text=The%20different%20Process%20States&text=READY%20%2D%20The%20process%20is%20waiting,The%20process%20has%20finished%20execution.)(Article)<br>
This link will provide an article that explains the various processes that occur when a program is executed. This is important because it is the fundamental basis of computing.

2. [Process State](https://youtu.be/jZ_6PXoaoxo)<br>
This video will explain the state of a process in an operating system program. This is because in a process, there can be more than one state that works simultaneously.

3. [Fork System Calls](https://youtu.be/IFEFVXvjiHY)<br>
This video will explain a system call to create a new process. The workings of creating a process certainly need to be understood to get through the basics of the program.

4. [Fork Visualization](https://youtu.be/QD9YKSg3wCc)<br>
Continuing from the previous video, this video will visualize how forks work to create a process. Of course, this relates to the relationship between the parent and child processes.

2. [What is RAID?](https://youtu.be/Aa0RTgxJJy8)<br>
   RAID or in other words redundant array of independent disks is a way to store the same data in different locations and multiple hard disks to maintain the data in case of failure. Therefore, this link will provide a video on how the RAID system works to achieve the purpose of the definition.
