## W01
1. [What is Linux?](https://youtu.be/rrB13utjYV4)<br>
Looks like it's time for us to know about Linux.
This video is all about Linux with simple explanations.

2. [Why Linux ?](https://youtu.be/otDOHt_Jges)<br>
Why do some people love and use Linux?
This video will uncover some of its feature.

3. [BASH Scripting](https://youtu.be/7qd5sqazD7k)<br>
Before I watched this video, I didn't know anything about scripting with Bash.
That's why I'm going to include this video to find out some of the simple scripting.

## W02
1.  [Protection in Operating Systems](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/14_Protection.html)<br>
All systems that work in this world must have a security management in it. Therefore, this link will explain some of the introduction of security aspects in operating systems.

2.  [Security Problems in Operating Systems](https://padakuu.com/what-is-the-security-problem-149-article)<br>
After we know the basics of security management, of course there will be some problems that will be faced when handling a system. Therefore we need to know some kinds of these problems.

3.  [Linux File Permission](https://youtu.be/k1yzI7c6Fzk)<br>
Linux is an operating system that implements multiple users. This will cause multiple users to access the same system. Therefore, to maintain the security of the files in it, it is necessary to manage access to their respective files. <br>
[additional documents](https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/) (The document used in the video)<br>

4. [Cryptography](https://youtu.be/6_Cxj5WKpIw)<br>
To send something with more security, then one of the techniques is cryptography. This video will explain the basics of cryptography.

5. [Encryption and public keys](https://youtu.be/6-JjHa-qLPk)<br>
The world is already using a lock to ensure more secure communications. The key can be public so that everyone can then access it. Inside the key, of course, there is an encryption and decryption process. Therefore this video will show the concept of these aspects.

## W03
1. [Linux FIle System](https://youtu.be/HbgzrKJvDRw)<br> 
This video explains what folders and directories exist in Linux and their uses. Of course it is useful to know the file system in Linux so that you can know which directory is used for a particular command.

2. [File System Commands](https://gist.github.com/khazeamo/f762f532bfbc17d5bf396e9d4c2a9586)<br>
This link contains the commands used to access and do something about the file system in Linux.

3. [File System Implementation](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLskQvPDUk0sKgGGReUz7nMwYkDTbevUC1)<br>
This playlist will explain everything about file implementation in the operating system so that the process of the file system structure can be explored.

4. [Fragmentation in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/fragmentation-in-operating-system)<br>
This link explains about one of the problems in the operating system that involves memory, namely fragmentation.

## W04
1. [Pointers in C](https://youtu.be/mw1qsMieK5c)<br> 
This video will explain how pointers work in the C programming language. This is useful for accessing the address of a variable.

2. [Paging in Operating System](https://youtu.be/pJ6qrCB8pDw)<br>
This video will explain one way of memory management in the operating system, namely paging. Of course this is useful for storing and retrieving data from secondary storage to main memory.

3. [Paging](https://kuleuven-diepenbeek.github.io/osc-course/ch9-memory/paging/)(Article)<br>
This link will provide an article containing details from the previous paging.

4. [Address Mapping](https://schoettkr.github.io/knowledge-database/uni/os/06_lecture/)<br>
This link will explain some of the variations of memory mapping that occur in operating systems. Of course this is related to the process of mapping logical addresses to physical address space.

## W05
1. [Virtual Memory](https://youtu.be/2quKyPnUShQ)(Video)<br> 
This video will explain one of the secondary memory management techniques that can be part of the main memory. It is useful to know the processes, techniques, types, and workings of an operating system's storage.

2. [Virtual Memory](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/virtual-memory)(Article)<br>
This link provides an advanced explanation of virtual memory in addition to the explanation in the video.

3. [Process Table](https://exposnitc.github.io/os_design-files/process_table.html)(Article)<br>
This link will provide a system process that contains entries to a table where each entry contains some important information about a process. Of course, this is also related to the page table process which contains information about the physical location of a process from the pages.
